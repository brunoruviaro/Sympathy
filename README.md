# Sympathy (I know why the caged bird sings)

Piece for choir and pre-recorded sounds played through cellphones
Composers: Scot Hanna-Weir and Bruno Ruviaro

First performance: March 6, 2015, at Santa Clara University.


# Description

The piece starts with the conductor asking the audience to load one of three sound files to play from their cell phones. Direct links (or QR codes for scanning) should be provided in the program notes to facilitate the set up. The audience files are:

1. <https://soundcloud.com/scu-electronic-music/sympathy-audience-d-a-session>

2. <https://soundcloud.com/scu-electronic-music/sympathy-audience-bb-f-session>

3. <https://soundcloud.com/scu-electronic-music/sympathy-audience-e-c-session>

Audience members do not need to hit play precisely at the same time. The conductor should give a start cue, and hopefully everyone will hit play within 10-20 seconds or so.
